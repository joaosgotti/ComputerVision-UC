%This function displays the calibration image and allows the user to click
%in the image to get the input points. Left click on the chessboard corners
%and type the 3D coordinates of the clicked points in to the input box that
%appears after the click. You can also zoom in to the image to get more
%precise coordinates. To finish use the right mouse button for the last
%point.
%You don't have to do this all the time, just store the resulting xy and
%XYZ matrices and use them as input for your algorithms.


% === Task 2 DLT algorithm ===
[K, R, C, error_DLT] = runDLT(xy, XYZ, D_type);

% === Task 3 Gold algorithm ===

[K, R, t, error_GOLD] = runGold(xy, XYZ, D_type);

% === Task 4 Gold algorithm with radial distortion estimation ===

[K, R, t, Kd, error] = runGoldRadial(xy, XYZ, D_type);

% === Bonus: Undistort input Image ===

% [UImage] = image_undistort(Img_I, K, R, t, Kd);
